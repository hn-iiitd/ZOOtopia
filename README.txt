Assumptions Made -

3. Deals that are turned off can not be viewed by the visitor

6. Visitors can also apply Discount codes while purchasing tickets.
7. Visitors can buy a ticket for closed attractions and can also view them in view_attractions, but cannot visit them until it is open by the admin.
8. if Visitor gives an invalid Discount Coupon for ticket purchase the Payment proceeds further.
9. Admin needs to enter Animal Sound along with Animal Name and type when adding a new Animal.
10. Admin needs to enter Attraction ticket price also when adding a new attraction.
11. Admin can't remove animal if there are only 2 animals left of that category.(Ensuring atleast two animals of each type in the ZOO)
12. Category of animals can't be changed while updating animal details.
13. Added 6 animals , 2 of each type in main() function of Main.java.Admin Can add more using manage_animals().
14. Added 2 Discount Coupons, MINOR10 and SENIOR20 in main() function of Main.java file. Can add more using Set Discount option.
15. Admin can add new Discounts by just adding category and percentage. I have Made a method to generate a discountCode. Admin can also change the autogenerated coupon code using modify_discounts.
16. Added 2 Attraction in main() of Main.java , Admin can add more using manage Attractions.
17. add_animals method don't ask the admin for animal details , but it can be added using modify animals.
18. Added apply DiscountCode in Buy Ticket, since it was mentioned in assignment text.
19. The Program ensures that there should be atleast two animals of each type in the zoo.
20. An attraction is open by default when added, can be turned off by schedule_event.
21. When a visitor is viewing attractions/Animals, and select any one , it shows the message to buy tickets and go to visit animals / attractions to visit them.
22. If there are no Visitors, the visitor stats shows any random Attraction as most popular and rest fields as 0.
23. Price of attraction will always be a +ve value.
24. If a visitor dont want to apply a discount code, then they need to write 'null' or 'none' to indicate they don't have a discount code.
25. If the admin has not added animal_details by going to update_animals section, the visitor will see it null.
26. A visitor can't buy multiple tickets for a single attraction at once.
27. Attraction Details are printed when a visitor views an attraction .
